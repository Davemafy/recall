# Guestbook

**Every visit teaches the business.**

Guestbook is an offline-first Small AI prototype for small tourism operators. It turns messy visitor comments, questions and needs into structured, inspectable business memory while keeping the original evidence and final decision with the operator.

## Working product

- Guest mode with English and Kiswahili prompts
- Local multi-label inference with zero network requests
- Human review and correction before a signal enters memory
- IndexedDB persistence
- Evidence grouped across distinct visits
- Decision prompts that never act automatically
- PWA/service worker for offline reopening
- /lab for local inference and on-device regression testing

## Small AI architecture

Guestbook deliberately does not use a general-purpose LLM in its critical path.

Guestbook Micro v1 is a tiny multilabel classifier:
- hashed character n-grams (3 to 5 characters)
- 2,048 feature dimensions
- 15 bounded labels including UNKNOWN
- one-vs-rest logistic classifiers pretrained and bundled with the app
- approximately 120 KB of learned weights in memory
- synthetic prototype corpus covering English, Kiswahili and informal Nigerian English/Pidgin patterns
- no model download, API key, server inference, or generated JSON

The learned weights are frozen into the app, so a cold offline reopen performs inference immediately without training or a network.

## Responsible AI

Raw source text is always preserved. The model can abstain with UNKNOWN. Accessibility and dietary/safety signals are explicitly marked for human confirmation. Guestbook does not automatically send messages, accept bookings, change prices, or make safety decisions. Demo records are visibly marked as demo data.

## Evaluation

The /lab route runs a frozen synthetic stress set on the actual in-browser model and reports micro precision, recall, F1, exact-match rate, training time, model weight footprint and median local inference latency.

Those numbers are regression evidence for this prototype. They are not claimed as field accuracy. The next validation step is a separately collected, human-labeled tourism dataset that is never used to tune the model.

## Offline proof

1. Open Guestbook once while connected.
2. Visit Guest mode and /lab once so the app assets are cached.
3. Close the app.
4. Enable airplane mode.
5. Reopen Guestbook.
6. Classify a new observation.
7. The inference path uses zero network requests.
